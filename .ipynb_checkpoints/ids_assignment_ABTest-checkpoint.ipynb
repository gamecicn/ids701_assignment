Note that there are TWO datasets for this test – one for the control data (users who saw the original design), and one for treatment data (users who saw the experimental design). Udacity decided to show their test site to 1/2 of visitors, so there are roughly the same number of users appearing in each dataset (though this is not a requirement of AB tests)."

That makes it analogous to gender or age in experiments where you have demographic data – a person’s age and gender are determined before they experience any manipulations, so the value of any pre-treatment attributes should be the same across the two arms of our experiment. This is what is called “checking for balance.” If pre-treatment attributes aren’t balanced, then we know our attempt to randomly assign people to different groups failed.\n",

Moreover, in other settings you may find this effect is even larger – the date indicators we added to our data are perfectly balanced between treatment and control, so we aren’t adding a lot of data to the model by adding them as variables.
