Note that there are TWO datasets for this test – one for the control data (users who saw the original design), and one for treatment data (users who saw the experimental design). Udacity decided to show their test site to 1/2 of visitors, so there are roughly the same number of users appearing in each dataset (though this is not a requirement of AB tests)."

    "Whenever you are working with experimental data, the first thing you want to do is verify that users actually were randomly sorted into the two arms of the experiment. In this data, half of users were supposed to be shown the old version of the site and half were supposed to see the new version.\n",

Pageviews is what is sometimes called an “invariant” variable, meaning that it shouldn’t vary across treatment arms – after all, people have to visit the site before they get a chance to see the treatment, so there’s no way that being assigned to treatment or control should affect the number of pageviews assigned to each group.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Invariant” variables are also an example of what are known as a “pre-treatment” variable, because pageviews are determined before users are manipulated in any way. That makes it analogous to gender or age in experiments where you have demographic data – a person’s age and gender are determined before they experience any manipulations, so the value of any pre-treatment attributes should be the same across the two arms of our experiment. This is what is called “checking for balance.” If pre-treatment attributes aren’t balanced, then we know our attempt to randomly assign people to different groups failed.\n",

Moreover, in other settings you may find this effect is even larger – the date indicators we added to our data are perfectly balanced between treatment and control, so we aren’t adding a lot of data to the model by adding them as variables. As we’ll see in later exercises, adding variables like “gender” or “age” (which will never be perfectly balanced across treatment and control) will help even more."
